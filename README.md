## 1. Introduction

In this document, we will discuss the process of developing and deploying an application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 using a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. We will leverage Docker for containerization to ensure consistency across environments and streamline the deployment process.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- AWS account with permissions to create EC2 instances and manage other necessary services.
- Basic understanding of Docker and containerization concepts.
- Familiarity with CI/CD principles and tools.

## 3. Setting Up AWS EC2 Instance

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Launch a new EC2 instance with appropriate configuration (instance type, security groups, etc.).
4. Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH.

## 4. Dockerizing the Application

1. Prepare your application for Dockerization by creating a Dockerfile.
2. Define the necessary dependencies and configurations in the Dockerfile.
3. Build the Docker image using the Docker CLI.
4. Test the Docker image locally to ensure it functions as expected.

## 5. Setting Up CI/CD Pipeline

### Choosing CI/CD Tool

1. Evaluate different CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, etc.
2. Choose the tool that best fits your requirements and infrastructure.

### Configuring CI/CD Pipeline

1. Configure the CI/CD pipeline to monitor your application repository for changes.
2. Define the stages of the pipeline, including build, test, and deploy.
3. Integrate Docker into the pipeline to build and push Docker images to a registry.
4. Configure deployment steps to deploy the application to the EC2 instance.

## 6. Deploying the Application

1. Ensure that the CI/CD pipeline is triggered automatically upon code changes.
2. Monitor the pipeline execution and address any failures or issues.
3. Once the pipeline successfully completes, verify the deployment on the EC2 instance.
4. Monitor application performance and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

## 7. Conclusion

In conclusion, deploying applications on AWS EC2 using a CI/CD pipeline with Docker significantly streamlines the development and deployment process. By automating the build, test, and deployment stages, teams can deliver updates faster and with greater reliability.
